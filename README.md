# Parameterized ALU in Verilog

This project implements a **parameterized Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)** in Verilog along with a testbench and waveform generation for functional verification.

## Features
- Data width (8-bit)
- Performs arithmetic and logical operations:
  - Addition  
  - Subtraction  
  - Bitwise AND, OR, XOR  
  - Logical shift left and right  
  - Comparison (A < B)
- Zero flag generation
- Complete testbench with stimulus 
- Waveform dump using VCD for EPWave

## Simulation
The design was verified using **Icarus Verilog** on **EDA Playground**.

Steps:
1. Compile the design and testbench  
2. Run simulation  
3. View waveform using EPWave/GTKWave
